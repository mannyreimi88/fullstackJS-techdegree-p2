A pagination script with two functions:
- `showPage(list, page)` for handling the paging logic
- `appendPageLinks(list)` for dynamically adding page links with the necessary 'click' event logic
- two global variables are declared:
    - `students` is the collection of items to be paginated
    - `studentsPerPage` is a constant, the 'maximum' no. of items to be displayed per page
